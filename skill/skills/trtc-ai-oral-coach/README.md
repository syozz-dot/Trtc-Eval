# AI Oral Coach Skill

> Build an AI English speaking coach powered by TRTC Conversational AI — zero code, voice-first. Two paths, both agent-driven: you just talk, the agent does the rest.

## About Tencent RTC

[Tencent RTC](https://trtc.io/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=skill&utm_campaign=Twitter%20AI%20%E4%B8%93%E9%A1%B9%20-%20AI%20Oral%20Coach&_channel_track_key=HIzH2eVJ) (Real-Time Communication) powers real-time audio, video, and conversational AI experiences for thousands of businesses worldwide. With a global edge network spanning 200+ countries and regions, TRTC delivers sub-300ms ultra-low latency at scale.

The **Conversational AI** capability enables developers to build voice agents that can listen, understand, and respond naturally — perfect for language learning, speaking practice, and interactive tutoring.

## What is this?

A plug-and-play Skill that builds an AI English speaking coach — packaged into a single agent-driven workflow:

```
You (in your IDE's AI chat window):
  "Build me an AI English speaking coach"

AI (does everything automatically):
  1. Checks your runtime environment
  2. Lets you choose Quick Experience or Integrate into My System
  3. Guides you through 3 keys setup (cloud service credentials)
  4. Installs dependencies and assembles coach capabilities
  5. Starts the service and gives you a browser URL

You never open a terminal or run a script manually.
```

## Two ways to start

| Mode | Who it's for | What you get | What you need |
|------|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Quick Experience** | First-timers who want to see it in action | Full 3-screen SPA (scenario practice + sentence correction + reply suggestions + 4-dimension report) | 3 keys |
| **Integrate into My System** | Users who already have an app and want backend capabilities | Backend API endpoints + integration samples (no UI) | 3 keys + choose coach capabilities |

## What are the 3 keys?

To get the coach running, you need 3 cloud service credentials:

| Key | Purpose | Where to find it |
|-----|---------|-----------------|
| 1: TRTC App Credentials | Voice channel for the coach | https://console.trtc.io/?quickclaim=engine_trial&utm_source=github&utm_medium=skill&utm_campaign=Twitter%20AI%20%E4%B8%93%E9%A1%B9%20-%20AI%20Oral%20Coach&_channel_track_key=3WFHfiqw |
| 2: Tencent Cloud API Key | Backend permissions (login syncs with TRTC) | https://console.tencentcloud.com/cam/capi?utm_source=github&utm_medium=skill&utm_campaign=Twitter%20AI%20%E4%B8%93%E9%A1%B9%20-%20AI%20Oral%20Coach&_channel_track_key=v0K1Q0DSE |
| 3: LLM API Key | The coach's "brain" — understand, correct, generate reports | Your AI provider (OpenAI, DeepSeek, etc.) |

## What capabilities does the coach have?

| Capability | Description | Quick Experience | Integration |
|------------|-------------|:---:|:---:|
| Scenario Roleplay | Scene × difficulty × style → dynamic roleplay | ✅ Default | 🔘 Optional |
| Quick Correct | Per-sentence speaking-style correction | ✅ Default | 🔘 Optional |
| Reply Suggestion | Conversation continuation hints | ✅ Default | 🔘 Optional |
| Ability Report | 4-dimension analysis report (en/zh bilingual) | ✅ Default | 🔘 Optional |
| Custom Learning KB | Connect your own teaching materials (Dify/Coze) | ❌ | 🔘 Optional |

> 💡 Evaluator capabilities (roleplay/correct/suggest/report) share a single `Evaluator` Port — swap LLM or prompt = "swap the brain", no core changes needed.

## Installation

Install via `npx` — works with any IDE, no plugin marketplace required. Run inside your project directory:

```bash
# Default — auto-detect installed IDEs and install for each one found
npx -y @tencent-rtc/trtc-agent-skills@latest add

# Force install for every supported IDE
npx -y @tencent-rtc/trtc-agent-skills@latest add --ide all

# Install only for one specific IDE
npx -y @tencent-rtc/trtc-agent-skills@latest add --ide cursor

# Wipe a previous install before re-installing
npx -y @tencent-rtc/trtc-agent-skills@latest add --clean
```
